## History of the Visual Metaphysics Series

Fred Stewart Keziah (1920-2010) was a Navy-trained illustrator and graphics specialist who created the "Visual Metaphysics" series of information charts in the mid-1950s. These self-published charts were sold via mail order for $1.00 each and advertised in magazines such as Fate and Flying Saucers.

The series reflects the eclectic interests of the post-war era: the first chart covered UFOs and flying saucer lore, while the second tackled spiritual metaphysics. Both charts demonstrate Keziah's methodical approach to complex phenomena, visualizing abstract concepts through the language of mid-century modern design.

Original prints of these charts are extremely rare, making digital preservation efforts particularly valuable for researchers and enthusiasts.
